# APKGrabber
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jamesalfei/apkgrabber.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jamesalfei/apkgrabber)

APKGrabber is a fork of [APKUpdater](https://github.com/rumboalla/apkupdater). Big thanks and of course
all credits go to [rumboalla](https://github.com/rumboalla).
I try to develop new features and maintain the software to stay available on latest android devices,
but don't expect weekly updates.

# Roadmap
* [ ] Implementing more sources.
  - [x] Aptoide
* [ ] Updating the build system, as it's full of deprecation warnings.
